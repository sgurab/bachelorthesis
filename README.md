# Bachelor thesis
Repository dedicaded to keep track of the quantitative part of my bachelor thesis. Here the goal is not to go any close to the boarder of knownledge whatsoever, but to do something decent and reliable. Hope it can be also interesting tho. This work will be presented to the University of São Paulo to obtain a bachelor's degree in business administration. 

## Theme and Objective
This work is about the regional differences on the compliance of a measure. Basically, according to the brazilian constitution of laws, each municipality should use at least 30% of the money they get from FNDE (Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento da Educação) for buying food for public schools from local producers (family farming). 

Previous researches, such as SIQUEIRA (2023), show that the regional differences play an important role on the compliance. The point here is to go further into it and comprehend differences along two pretty contrasting regions of Brazil: northeast and south. 

## How are we approaching it?
Loaded with a data base containing all the data we need, we will build a simple quantitative analysis based on two steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis focusing on the missing values and dealing with them;
2. Decision Trees Algorithms to classify either the compliance is likely to happen or not. Plus defining the hierarchy between the variables.
